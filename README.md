Custom shell script bindings to make my life easier. To use, simply copy the folder into any directory, remove extensions from all files (eg: `mv proxy.sh proxy`), do `chmod +x` on all files to make them executable, and add the path to the directory to the PATH environment variable in macOS (ie: in `.zprofile`: `export PATH=<path to directory>:$PATH`). Then restart terminal.
